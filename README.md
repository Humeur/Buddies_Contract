  <b>Our initiative was not for commercial purposes and does not encourage investment in NFTs <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/774410/heres-the-problem-with-nfts/">(in fact, it is rather an advice not to do so)</a>, at least not in the current state of the market</b>.<br>

  This project was aimed to learn how to <b>build products on the blockchain</b> and to deploy them in order to learn more about <b>web3</b>.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  NFT being relatively easy to set up, we chose it and <b>we did the whole project ourselves</b>, from the development of the contract to the creation of the assets in pixelart.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  We developed this project using <a href="https://soliditylang.org/">Solidity</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">Smart Contract</a> and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> for the generator.<br>

  This project was done by <a href="https://github.com/bricerigagneau">Brice Rigagneau</a> and myself <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/livio-dal-maso-43a318198/">Livio Dal Maso</a>.

<h2 align="center">Buddies Contract</h2>
<p align="center">
 A Solidity contract made for the Buddies Project, fully tested and ready for deployment on Ethereum blockchain.<br>
  This contract was specifically made by me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/livio-dal-maso-43a318198/">Livio Dal Maso</a>.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  The Buddies contract is a fairly typical contract that implements a few add-ons, the main one being the implementation of a marketplace.
  If the Buddies were ever deployed, they should be able to be exchanged without suffering from the transaction costs of existing marketplaces, this contract implements    a way to exchange Buddies for ETH and vice-versa.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  It is worth mentioning that given the rapid evolution of this technology, the contract is likely to be totally obsolete so I strongly advise you not to deploy it or to use this code to create your own contract ( if it will be deployed).<br>
