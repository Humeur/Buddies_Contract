  This project was aimed to learn how to <b>build products on the blockchain</b> and to deploy them in order to learn more about <b>web3</b>.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  NFT being relatively easy to set up, we chose it and <b>we did the whole project ourselves</b>, from the development of the contract to the creation of the assets in pixelart.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  We developed this project using <a href="https://soliditylang.org/">Solidity</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">Smart Contract</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> for the generator, <a href="https://fr.reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> for the front and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> for the back end of our website.<br>
